## Features

This is a basic, semi-minimalist scientific calculator that has a number of essential functions used in science and math classes.
The calculator also has a minalislt speech recognistion system (in english).To use these features, you need to install the following libraries using pip:

    1. Pygame (mixer)
    ```Python
    * pip install pygame

    2. Speech Recognition
    ```Python
    * pip install speechrecognition
    ```

    3. Pyaudio (for voice input)
    ```Python
    * pip install pyaudio
    ```

### Pre-requisites
On the module level, the 'math' and 'tkinter' module is already imported and included in the code.
```Python
from tkinter import *
from math import*
```

### Installing
Download any Python 3 IDE and run the code, or you can clone/download it from the homepage of the project.

## Deployment
Run the code

## Built With
